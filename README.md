## 🛠️ Tailwind CSS Setup

For a step-by-step Tailwind setup, see [tailwind-setup.md](./tailwind-setup.md).

If you are using Tailwind CSS, you can use [Tailwind Play CDN](https://play.tailwindcss.com/) for simple projects, or set up Tailwind locally for advanced usage. Example CDN setup:

```html
<!-- In your HTML <head> -->
<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
```

For full setup, see the [Tailwind CSS Installation Guide](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation).
